**Birdy flap** is a game based on a classic arcade Flappy Bird.

The only thing is.. imagine how the pipes must feel as the villains all the time. We wish to end the pipe-hate. As such, we present the **Birdy Flap**, which is all about the pipes.

The project is a collaborative work of Micha≈Ç Greszta and Bartosz Janik.
